Then open 4 terminals, and run all these files at the same time. The server is going to connect each of the terminals and perform federated learning.
You dont need the iotML.py file to run fl. iotML.py is when I am using the same model but in cenntralized machine learning.
You could run both FL and ML on both the models and then compare results after saving the models.
